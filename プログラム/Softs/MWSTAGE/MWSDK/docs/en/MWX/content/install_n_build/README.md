# Install and Build

In order to write an application using the MWX library (called ACT in this document) and run it, you need to set up a development environment.

* [Enviromnents for TWELITE STAGE SDK](1_environment.md)
* [Installing TWELITE STAGE SDK](2_install_sdk.md)
* [(Optional) Installing Visual Stdio code](install_vscode.md)
* [Building ACT](3_building-act.md)
* [Create a new project](create_new_project.md)
* [Makefile](makefile.md)
* [Use part of MWX code at another platoform(e.g. stdio environment)](nopurattofmu.md)
