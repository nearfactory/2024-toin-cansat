# HW API reference

Many of the hardware handling procedures use the procedures described in the semiconductor peripheral API manual.

In the TWELITE SDK, we have compiled a library of typical peripheral API procedures for commonly used UARTs and other hardware.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all hardware is libraryable. It is used in a mixed way with the peripheral API.
