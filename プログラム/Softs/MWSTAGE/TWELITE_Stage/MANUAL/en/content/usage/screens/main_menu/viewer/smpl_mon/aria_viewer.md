## TWELITE ARIA

![Screen example](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/stage-viewer-aria.png)

The default setting (ARIA mode) of TWELITE ARIA wakes up due to several factors and transmits various information after waking up while driving intermittently using sleep, which can be operated even with coin cell batteries.

#### Wake-up factors

* Wake-up by timer (periodic wake-up by set value)
* Wake-up by magnetic sensor (when a magnet is detected approaching)

#### Transmitted data

* Module power supply voltage
* Magnetic sensor detection value
* Temperature and humidity data

### Packet

Displays basic packet information.
