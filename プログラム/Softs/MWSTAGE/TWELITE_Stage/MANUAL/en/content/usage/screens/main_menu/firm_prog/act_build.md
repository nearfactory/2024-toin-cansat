# Act build&Wrt

Build and rewrite Act. (Windows/Mac/Linux)

{% hint style="success" %}
Focus on small-scale source code that can be used as a reference for writing Act (Act).
{% endhint %}

![selection screen](../../../../.gitbook/assets/img_fimprog_act_sel.png)

When this screen is opened, a list of projects is displayed. Select the project you wish to write, and the build - write will be performed. After writing is complete, press `Enter` or `[ B ]` button to reset the TWELITE radio module and go to the Interactive settings mode screen (or Terminal screen, configuration required).
