### Windows/Mac/Linux/RaspberryPi(X11)

TWELITE STAGE is an application that is launched from the console screen (command line). Information is output to both the console screen and the window screen.

The console screen outputs the same information as the terminal.

{% hint style="info" %}
The console screen is accepted in some environments, but it is not a confirmed official feature.
{% endhint %}



### RaspberryPi(FB)

The screen is displayed on a framebuffer without X11.
The console screen is not normally displayed (when started from a shell screen on the framebuffer).
